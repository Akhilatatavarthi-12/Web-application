    <p>This project is about Soil Suitability Analysis is a simple yet effective method to evaluate whether a particular soil is appropriate for growing crops.
      This tool considers key soil properties such as pH level, soil type, and moisture content, which are critical factors influencing plant growth.
      Soil pH affects nutrient availability, soil type determines water retention and aeration, and moisture level impacts the overall health of crops. 
      By analyzing these parameters, the tool provides a basic recommendation on how suitable the soil is for cultivation,
      helping farmers and gardeners make informed decisions about land use and crop selection.
      While this analysis is simplified, it serves as a good starting point for understanding soil conditions and planning agricultural activities.</p>
